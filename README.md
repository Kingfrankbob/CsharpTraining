Just Messing around and having fun in C sharp

# Why?
This was a training course offered to me with a relative, and so I could not resist. I had always hated C#, and so this was a good learning point for me.

# Projects
The themes are written in the folder, and the namespaces are just silly!
#To run each?
Navigate to the seperate folders and do the "dotnet run" command, or you can build it if you'd like first to make sure its good.
